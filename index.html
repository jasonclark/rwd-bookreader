<h1>The Mysteries of Udolpho, Chapter 1</h1>

    On the pleasant banks of the Garonne, in the province of Gascony, stood,
      in the year 1584, the chateau of Monsieur St. Aubert. From its windows
      were seen the pastoral landscapes of Guienne and Gascony stretching along
      the river, gay with luxuriant woods and vine, and plantations of olives.
      To the south, the view was bounded by the majestic Pyrenees, whose
      summits, veiled in clouds, or exhibiting awful forms, seen, and lost
      again, as the partial vapours rolled along, were sometimes barren, and
      gleamed through the blue tinge of air, and sometimes frowned with forests
      of gloomy pine, that swept downward to their base. These tremendous
      precipices were contrasted by the soft green of the pastures and woods
      that hung upon their skirts; among whose flocks, and herds, and simple
      cottages, the eye, after having scaled the cliffs above, delighted to
      repose. To the north, and to the east, the plains of Guienne and Languedoc
      were lost in the mist of distance; on the west, Gascony was bounded by the
      waters of Biscay.
</p>
<p>
      M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with his wife and daughter, on the margin
      of the Garonne, and to listen to the music that floated on its waves. He
      had known life in other forms than those of pastoral simplicity, having
      mingled in the gay and in the busy scenes of the world; but the flattering
      portrait of mankind, which his heart had delineated in early youth, his
      experience had too sorrowfully corrected. Yet, amidst the changing visions
      of life, his principles remained unshaken, his benevolence unchilled; and
      he retired from the multitude 'more in PITY than in anger,' to scenes of
      simple nature, to the pure delights of literature, and to the exercise of
      domestic virtues.
</p>
<p>
      He was a descendant from the younger branch of an illustrious family, and
      it was designed, that the deficiency of his patrimonial wealth should be
      supplied either by a splendid alliance in marriage, or by success in the
      intrigues of public affairs. But St. Aubert had too nice a sense of honour
      to fulfil the latter hope, and too small a portion of ambition to
      sacrifice what he called happiness, to the attainment of wealth. After the
      death of his father he married a very amiable woman, his equal in birth,
      and not his superior in fortune. The late Monsieur St. Aubert's
      liberality, or extravagance, had so much involved his affairs, that his
      son found it necessary to dispose of a part of the family domain, and,
      some years after his marriage, he sold it to Monsieur Quesnel, the brother
      of his wife, and retired to a small estate in Gascony, where conjugal
      felicity, and parental duties, divided his attention with the treasures of
      knowledge and the illuminations of genius.
