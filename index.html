<p>
On the pleasant banks of the Garonne, in the province of Gascony, stood,
in the year 1584, the chateau of Monsieur St. Aubert. From its windows
were seen the pastoral landscapes of Guienne and Gascony stretching along
the river, gay with luxuriant woods and vine, and plantations of olives.
To the south, the view was bounded by the majestic Pyrenees, whose
summits, veiled in clouds, or exhibiting awful forms, seen, and lost
again, as the partial vapours rolled along, were sometimes barren, and
gleamed through the blue tinge of air, and sometimes frowned with forests
of gloomy pine, that swept downward to their base. These tremendous
precipices were contrasted by the soft green of the pastures and woods
that hung upon their skirts; among whose flocks, and herds, and simple
cottages, the eye, after having scaled the cliffs above, delighted to
repose. To the north, and to the east, the plains of Guienne and Languedoc
were lost in the mist of distance; on the west, Gascony was bounded by the
waters of Biscay.
</p>
<p>
M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with his wife and daughter, on the margin
of the Garonne, and to listen to the music that floated on its waves. He
had known life in other forms than those of pastoral simplicity, having
mingled in the gay and in the busy scenes of the world; but the flattering
portrait of mankind, which his heart had delineated in early youth, his
experience had too sorrowfully corrected. Yet, amidst the changing visions
of life, his principles remained unshaken, his benevolence unchilled; and
he retired from the multitude 'more in PITY than in anger,' to scenes of
simple nature, to the pure delights of literature, and to the exercise of
domestic virtues.
</p>
<p>
He was a descendant from the younger branch of an illustrious family, and
it was designed, that the deficiency of his patrimonial wealth should be
supplied either by a splendid alliance in marriage, or by success in the
intrigues of public affairs. But St. Aubert had too nice a sense of honour
to fulfil the latter hope, and too small a portion of ambition to
sacrifice what he called happiness, to the attainment of wealth. After the
death of his father he married a very amiable woman, his equal in birth,
and not his superior in fortune. The late Monsieur St. Aubert's
liberality, or extravagance, had so much involved his affairs, that his
son found it necessary to dispose of a part of the family domain, and,
some years after his marriage, he sold it to Monsieur Quesnel, the brother
of his wife, and retired to a small estate in Gascony, where conjugal
felicity, and parental duties, divided his attention with the treasures of
knowledge and the illuminations of genius.
